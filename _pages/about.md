Hey there! I'm James, a Data Engineer based in Sydney, NSW, who loves diving into data to develop pipelines enabling data-driven decisions. Solving tricky data problems is what I enjoy doing. I'm always learning and staying on top of the latest trends to bring fresh ideas to the table

I've previously worked in a variety of technical roles (Software Developer, IT Engineer, Techincal Support Specialist) and have cultivated a diverse experience base and set of skills. The variety in data I've been exposed to in these roles has solidified my want to work in data.

I hold a BSc. in Software Development from Munster Techincal University, a Certificate of Data Engineering from North Alberta Institute of Technology and a Certificate of Data Analytics: Machine Learning from University College Dublin. Now, I'm working towards my Azure data certificates

When I'm not working or studying, you can usually find me playing soccer or out running
